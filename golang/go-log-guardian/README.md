# Docker Compose for Log Guardian Databases

This `docker-compose.yml` file is designed to set up a local environment for testing and integrating the **Log Guardian project**. It creates services for various databases, including:

* **PostgreSQL**
* **MySQL**
* **SQLite** (usually accessed via volume or host-mount)
* **MongoDB**

This setup enables comprehensive validation of the Log Guardian's logging, parsing, and integration capabilities across multiple database engines.
