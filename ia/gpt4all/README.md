# GPT4All Mark One

This project provides a Dockerized environment to **build and run [GPT4All](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all)** â€” an open-source framework for running large language models locally.

The container setup is ideal for experimentation, local development, and exploring the capabilities of GPT4All without polluting your host system.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this container is to:

* Simplify the process of compiling GPT4All from source
* Provide a portable and isolated runtime
* Facilitate local testing and learning with open-source LLMs
