# Docker-Build-Library

Docker-Hub is a centralized repository for Dockerfiles, providing a collection of environment templates, base images, and configurations for various development and production scenarios. This project serves as a hub for Docker images commonly used across multiple projects, simplifying the setup and deployment process.

## Features

- Centralized Dockerfiles: Collection of Dockerfiles for various languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Environment-Specific Configurations: Tailored configurations for development, staging, and production.
- Multi-Project Support: Reusable images that can be integrated into different projects seamlessly.
- Optimized for CI/CD: Pre-configured images for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Structure

The repository is organized by directories, each representing a specific language, framework, or tool. Each directory contains Dockerfiles, configuration files, and, if necessary, documentation.

### Example structure

```bash
docker-build-library
├── language1/
│   ├── project1/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── project2/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── README.md
├── language2/
│   ├── project1/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── project2/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   └── README.md
└── README.md
```
